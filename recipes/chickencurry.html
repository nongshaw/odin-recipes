    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You might be confused by the name of this recipe. Chicken curry?
            But what type of curry? Green, red? Is it Indian? Is it Malaysian?
            To which I say, please do not follow this recipe. I'm just in the mood
            for some chicken, and for a curry. So here we are, and here we go.
        </p>
        <p>I did cook something like this a week or two ago and it didn't quite
            turn out the way I wanted, but it was still delicious as.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 Brown onion</li>
            <li>Rice - I choose Jasmine Rice, but it's up to taste</li>
            <li>Curry sauce</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the onions in a frying pan with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Once the onions are browned, add the chicken.</li>
            <li>Cook until browned and cooked through. Add the curry sauce. 
                Yes, from a tin, or a glass bottle. It's legit. Though not 
                cost effective. And hardly requires a recipe.</li>
        </ol>
